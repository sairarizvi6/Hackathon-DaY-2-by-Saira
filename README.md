Marketplace-Technical-Foundation

Marketplace Plan:

Frontend Features:

•	Homepage: I’ve designed a visually engaging homepage with banners and easy navigation to my featured categories like "Living Room," "Bedroom," etc.

•	Product Listing: I display products with images, names, prices, and ratings. I include filters for price, material, size, and other attributes to refine the search.

•	Product Details: I provide detailed information, including images, dimensions, material specs, pricing, and user reviews to help customers make informed decisions.

•	Shopping Cart: My cart shows selected items with options to modify quantities, remove items, and apply promo codes for discounts.

•	Checkout: I’ve created a simple interface to enter shipping details, select payment methods, and review the order before finalizing the purchase.

•	Order Confirmation: After completing a purchase, I display order details, estimated delivery dates, and tracking info.

Sanity CMS:
•	Product Management: I manage product details, images, prices, and descriptions in my Sanity CMS.
•	Category Management: I organize products into categories like "Living Room" and "Bedroom," and I can easily add new categories as my inventory grows.
•	Order Management: I track the status of each order (Pending, Shipped, Delivered) and manage payment and shipment details.

Third-Party APIs:
•	Payment Gateway: I integrate Stripe or PayPal to securely handle payments on my website.
•	Shipment Tracking: I integrate AfterShip or another tracking API to provide real-time updates on shipments.

System Architecture:
•	Frontend (Next.js): I use Next.js for my frontend to ensure fast loading, good SEO, and a smooth user experience.
•	Sanity CMS: I rely on Sanity CMS to manage my product data, categories, and orders in one place.
•	Product Data API: I use an API to fetch product data from my CMS and display it on my site.
•	Third-Party APIs: I connect to external APIs for payment processing (Stripe/PayPal) and shipment tracking (AfterShip).

API Requirements:
1.	Fetch Products: I use the /products endpoint to get product details like name, price, and description.
2.	Fetch Categories: I call the /categories endpoint to get the categories of my products.
3.	Search Products: I use the /search endpoint to allow users to search for products based on various criteria.
4.	Add to Cart: I use the /cart/add endpoint to add selected products to the shopping cart.
5.	Track Shipment: I use the /shipment endpoint to retrieve real-time shipment tracking for orders.
